# Write a program that asks the user for the lengths of the two perpendicular sides of a right triangle and outputs the length of the third side (the hypotenuse) using the Pythagorean theorem!

# The Pythagorean theorem, named after the ancient Greek thinker, Pythagoras, is a fundamental relation in geometry. It states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides.

# For instance, let's consider a right triangle ABC, with the right angle located at C. According to the Pythagorean theorem:

# BC ** 2 = AB ** 2 + AC ** 2

# Your code should read in the lengths of the sides AB and AC, and that outputs the length of the hypotenuse (BC). You will probably find math.sqrt() to be useful.

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):

# Enter the length of AB: 3

# Enter the length of AC: 4

# The length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: 5.0

# Starter Code
# def main():
#     print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# # This provided line is required at the end of
# # Python file to call the main() function.
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     main()

def main():
    try:
        ab = float(input("Enter the length of AB: "))
        ac = float(input("Enter the length of AC: "))
        bc = math.sqrt(ab ** 2 + ac ** 2)
        print(f"\nThe length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: {bc}")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter valid numeric values for the sides.")
